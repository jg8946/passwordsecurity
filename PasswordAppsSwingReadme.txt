PasswordStrengthSwing

This app accepts a password entered in the form of a string variable on pressing the "check strength" button.
Each character is tested to see if it is one of four character types - special characters like punctuation,
numbers, and lower-case and upper-case letters. The string is also tested for length. Only a password which 
fulfils these tests will be considered secure.

RandomPasswordSwing

This app, on clicking the "generate password" button, will create a string of 12 characters with values chosen
randomly from a character map. Certain characters within the sequence are set to always contain a certain type
such as punctuation - this is so that any password generated will fulfill PassowrdStrengthSwing's tests.
